# The ease of doing business index 
### Business Intelligence with Tableau
 

## Introduction
For investors, it is highly relevant to know, how easy or challenging it is to do business in certain geographical regions. To attract, especially foreign investors, a country has to indicate its ease in doing business, and this can be demonstrated with the so-called the ease of doing business index. 

This index ranks 190 countries by using 10 subcategories to determine the overall score. A high score will be ranked first and a slow score results in bad ranking.


## Datasets 
I downloaded 2 datasets from www.doingbusiness.org. One contains the overall ranking as well as the ranking from the 10 subindices for 190 countries in 2020. The other one contains the actual overall score from 2019 and from 2020.

Ranking data: https://www.doingbusiness.org/en/rankings  

Score data: https://www.doingbusiness.org/en/data/doing-business-score 

I joined the 2 datasets in Tableau to create the visualizations.


## Workflow
There was no cleaning needed for those datasets, and I could start with visualizing the data straight away. 

First, I presented with the help of a world map the overall score of the ease of doing business. The darker blue a country, the higher is its score and the easier is it to do business there. On the contrary, the darker orange a country is, the lower its score and the more challenging it is to do business in that country.

Second, I showed the change in score from 2019 to 2020. Blue means, a country has increased its score from 2019 to 2020, while orange means it has lost in score.

Then, I listed the first 25 ranked countries as well as the bottom 25. We can see that many of the high ranked countries are OECD countries, while most the bottom ones are developing countries.

Next, I examined the ranking of the 10 subindices of the best ranked country (New Zealand) as well as the bottom one (Somalia). New Zealand consistently ranks well in its subcategories while Somalia consistently ranks among the bottom in most of the subindices.

After that, I used different kinds of visualizations to explore possible correlations between the subindices.
